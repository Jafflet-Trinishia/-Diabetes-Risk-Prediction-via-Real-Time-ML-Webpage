# -CLASSIFICATION AND PREDICTION OF DIABETES RISK USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES WITH REAL TIME WEBPAGE

# -INTRODUCTION
Diabetes diseases are the one cause of death worldwide over the last few decades
However, accurate detection  and consultation of a patient for 24 hours by a doctor is not available  . 
If it is  predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis. 
The accuracy of Training model should be higher and error rate should be minimum

# -OBJECTIVE
Produce a taxonomy of the state-of-the-art machine learning based diabetes disease detection systems.
Visualise the trends of  recent work on the domain
Identify there maining issues and describes potential future directions in this domain.

# -PROPOSED SYSTEM
Supervised learning is used for predication of outcome for both Diabetes . 
Based on various inputs like smoking, Diabetes rate, BP ,etcâ€¦. in order to predict the Diabetes . 
will predict the outcome and it is the one of the main advantage carried by this study and also
 In this study we develop the machine learning model and embed with web application so that it can be use it in the real time application.
